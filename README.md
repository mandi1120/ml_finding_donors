# WGU Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree <br>Finding Donors  
### By: Amanda Hanway, 12/23/2023 

## Introduction

This project employs several supervised machine learning algorithms to predict individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. 

The goal is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. In a nonprofit setting, this information can be used to determine prospective donors to solicit for donations. 

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).

View the code in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mandi1120/ml_finding_donors/blob/main/finding_donors.ipynb).
